After processing raw T1 scans with FreeSurfer 7, based on "nu.mgz" (head image) and "brain.mgz" (brain image), we extracted the skull portion (via python) and saved it to disk. 
Those files were used as sjull images for training the SkullAge model and testing it. 
The 10 sample skull image files here are in nii.gz format, but mgz/nii/np formats can also be used as input to model.
